# **CNCF & The Linux Foundation**  

## **1. Overview**  
The **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** and the **Linux Foundation** play a big role in the Cloud Native world. If you're working with Kubernetes, containers, or modern infrastructure, understanding what these organizations do is important—not just for the **KCNA exam**, but for working in tech in general.  

This section covers:  
- **What is the Linux Foundation?**  
- **What is CNCF?**  
- **The history of Kubernetes and how it ended up under CNCF**

## **2. The Linux Foundation**  
### **2.1 What is the Linux Foundation?**  
- **Founded in 2000** through a merger of:  
  - **Open Source Development Labs (OSDL)**  
  - **Free Standards Group (FSG)**  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Standardize **Linux**  
  - Support **open-source software development**  
  - Drive **commercial adoption** of Linux  
- **Key Contributions:**  
  - Hosts major **open-source projects** (Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, CNCF)  
  - **Funds Linus Torvalds** (creator of Linux) and **Greg Kroah-Hartman** (lead Linux Kernel maintainer)  
  - Backed by major companies: **Google, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung**  

### **2.2 Why the Linux Foundation Matters**  
- It's a **neutral organization** that helps **Linux and Cloud Native projects grow**.  
- It provides funding, governance, and standardization.  
- It **sponsors and maintains Kubernetes** under CNCF.

## **3. Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**  
### **3.1 What is CNCF?**  
- **Created in 2015** as a project under the Linux Foundation.  
- **Goal:**  
  - Support and promote **Cloud Native technologies**.  
  - Provide governance for **open-source Cloud Native projects**.  
  - Ensure **vendor neutrality** and encourage open collaboration.  
- **Key Contributions:**  
  - Oversees **hundreds of projects** (Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, Helm, etc.).  
  - Funds **open-source development** and brings together contributors.  
  - Runs **KubeCon + CloudNativeCon**, the biggest Kubernetes event.  

### **3.2 CNCF Project Tiers**  
CNCF categorizes its projects into three levels:  

| **Tier**        | **Description** | **Examples** |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Graduated**  | Stable, widely adopted projects | Kubernetes, Prometheus, Helm |
| **Incubating** | Actively developed, growing adoption | Contour, Falco, Argo |
| **Sandbox**    | Early-stage projects with potential | KubeEdge, OpenTelemetry |

## **4. Kubernetes & CNCF**  
### **4.1 How Kubernetes Became a CNCF Project**  
- **2015**: Kubernetes **v1.0 released** by **Google**.  
- **2015**: Google **donates Kubernetes** to CNCF.  
- **Why?** To make sure Kubernetes remained **vendor-neutral** and wasn’t controlled by one company.  
- **Result**: Kubernetes became CNCF’s **first project** and is now the **leading container orchestration platform**.  

### **4.2 Why CNCF Matters for Kubernetes**  
- Keeps Kubernetes **neutral** and **community-driven**.  
- Encourages **open collaboration and innovation**.  
- Ensures **Kubernetes development isn’t controlled by any single company**.

## **5. Exam Tips for KCNA**  
### **Key Things to Know for the Exam**  
- **The role of CNCF** in Cloud Native development.  
- **Why Google donated Kubernetes** to CNCF.  
- **How CNCF projects are structured** (Graduated, Incubating, Sandbox).  

### **Study Focus**  
- Understand **why the Linux Foundation exists** and how it supports open-source.  
- Learn how CNCF helps Kubernetes stay **open-source and independent**.  
- Be familiar with **CNCF project maturity levels** and how they work.  

---

## **6. Summary**  
- **The Linux Foundation** is behind Linux, Kubernetes, and CNCF. It provides **funding, governance, and standardization** for open-source projects.  
- **CNCF** focuses on **Cloud Native technologies** and manages **Kubernetes, Prometheus, and many other projects**.  
- **Kubernetes was created by Google** but was donated to CNCF to keep it **open-source and vendor-neutral**.  
- **CNCF projects follow a structured maturity model** (Graduated, Incubating, Sandbox).
